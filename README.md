# scribble.io
I want to learn more about WebSockets, so thought of making a clone of skribbl.io is the best way to learn since it involves many WebSocket concepts and backend API logic."
will not be focusing on frontend muc if there is enough time i will think about frontend part

tech stack im thinking about is
backend
node.js
express.js
socket.io

frontend
react
socket.io client
canvas api
